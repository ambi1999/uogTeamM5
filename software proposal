Software Proposal

As a group we are proposing a piece of software that could be used by lectures in universities. The software we are proposing to develop and implement is voting software. The voting software would be useful for lecturers to determine whether students have understood what they have been talking about. The voting software will use an Arduino which has an infrared sensor attached to it. The students will be given a keypad each and at certain points during the lecture the students will be asked a question with 4 possible answers and they will need to vote. The data will be read from the Arduino serial port and executed by a java program which will first store the data into a database and then retrieve the data from the database before calculating the votes for each option and displaying the output in a bar chart
Requirements

Recognize remote has been pressed
Recognize when voting has finished
Arduino program must connect to java program (read from serial port)
Java program must convert and store data to a database
Java program must retrieve data from database and calculate how many votes for each possible option 
Java program must display output as a bar chart.
